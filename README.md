# Project Overview

This is a project I did for the Udacity Front-end nanodegree program. This is a project using Jasmine.js which is a JavaScript testing framework.


## How this project works

Open index.html, the bottom of the page is the Jasmine tests.

There are some tests, each test tests a specific part of the web page.

1. RSS Feeds, this tests if the url and the name have been defined. 

2. The menu, this tests if the menu is hidden by default and if it will react to the click events accordingly.

3. Initial Entries, this tests if there is at least one single element in the .feed container.

4. New Feed Selection, this tests if the content actually changes.
